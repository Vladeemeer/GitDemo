Seeing as I’m a year-or-so late, I’ll answer with what I think will be the biggest and best mobile testing platforms for 2020 and beyond. These won’t be ranked or listed from best to worst, and they are just some of the platforms that I think will be worth keeping your eye on for the foreseeable future.

Appium
Ranorex
EarlGrey
TestFairy
TestFlight
TestIO
Kobiton
MonkeyTalk
Selendroid (Selenium for Android)
The above are, in my opinion, the best testing platforms for mobile app development in 2020 and onward. There’s stuff like Jenkins and Bamboo if you’re looking for specialized tools like CI (Continuous integration), but that’s about all I could come up with after some extensive research.
